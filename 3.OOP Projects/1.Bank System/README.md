# 🏦 Bank Management System

A full-featured Console-Based Banking Application built with **C++**. 
This project demonstrates the practical application of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **File Handling** to manage client data and transactions.

## 🌟 Project Features

* **Client Management:**
    * Add new clients.
    * Update existing client information.
    * Delete clients.
    * Search for a client by Account Number.
    * Show a list of all clients.
* **Transactions:**
    * Deposit funds.
    * Withdraw funds (with balance validation).
    * Check total balances.
* **Data Persistence:**
    * All data is saved automatically to text files (Database simulation).
    * Data is loaded automatically when the program starts.

## 🛠️ Technical Concepts Used

This project was built to master the following C++ concepts:
1.  **OOP Principles:** Encapsulation, Classes, and Objects.
2.  **File Handling:** Reading from and writing to files (`fstream`) to store data permanently.
3.  **String Manipulation:** Parsing data strings to objects and vice versa.
4.  **Vectors & Pointers:** Efficient memory management and data storage.
5.  **Validation:** Ensuring user input is correct and logical.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Compile the code using any C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2.  Run the executable file.
3.  Follow the on-screen menu to perform operations.
